1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,240
一個小小的病原體已經提醒我們所有人

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,500
人類的健康有多麼地脆弱

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,000
且與生態系、其它物種的健康息息相關

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
世界衛生組織估計

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
百分之 60 的傳染病源自不同的動物

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,760
瞭解能傳播疾病病原的物種

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
對於辨認、管理及潛在的健康威脅十分重要

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,520
有了全球生物多樣性資訊機構（GBIF）上共享的資料

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
 

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,160
各個不同領域的科學家及研究人員

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
找出疾病傳染途徑中的相關物種

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,280
並查出物種分布的改變情況

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,280
這些資料是

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,160
瞭解動物及宿主疾病傳播

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,920
and identifying areas at risk of potential outbreaks. 

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,720
Policymakers and public health officials can use the resulting insights

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,800
to prepare responses, focus surveillance and allocate resources

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,440
to protect people’s lives and livelihoods.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,680
When combined with climatic and environmental information, 

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,680
GBIF-mediated data sometimes reveals

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,120
and even predicts sites of disease spillover. 

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,080
In 2018, an analysis using data from the GBIF network 

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,880
identified a high-risk hotspot for the Nipah virus outbreak in southern India

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,800
just before the disease emerged there.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,480
By contributing to a "One Health" approach 

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,480
that recognizes the intimate connection 

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,040
between the well-being of humans, animals, and ecosystems, 

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
data shared through GBIF helps us

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,440
understand and prepare for potential disease risks, 

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,040
reducing the many costs of future disease outbreaks 

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
to keep people and the planet healthy.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,960
To learn more about the connections
