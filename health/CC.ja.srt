1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,240
小さな病原体に私たちは気付かされました。

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,500
人間の健康がいかに脆弱で、生態系や生物種の健全さと

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,000
いかに深く結びついているかということです。

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
世界保健機構（WHO）は全ての感染症のうち

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
60%が動物由来であると推定しました。

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,760
Knowing where the species that transmit disease-causing pathogens occur 

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
is important for recognizing, managing, and preventing potential health threats.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,520
With data shared through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility,

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,120
or GBIF, 

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,160
scientists and researchers from various disciplines 

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
map the species involved in cycles of disease transmission 

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,280
and how their distributions are changing.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,280
Such data offers an essential element in

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,160
understanding zoonotic and vector-borne diseases 

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,920
and identifying areas at risk of potential outbreaks. 

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,720
Policymakers and public health officials can use the resulting insights

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,800
to prepare responses, focus surveillance and allocate resources

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,440
to protect people’s lives and livelihoods.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,680
When combined with climatic and environmental information, 

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,680
GBIF-mediated data sometimes reveals

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,120
and even predicts sites of disease spillover. 

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,080
In 2018, an analysis using data from the GBIF network 

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,880
identified a high-risk hotspot for the Nipah virus outbreak in southern India

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,800
just before the disease emerged there.

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,480
By contributing to a "One Health" approach 

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,480
that recognizes the intimate connection 

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,040
between the well-being of humans, animals, and ecosystems, 

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
data shared through GBIF helps us

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,440
understand and prepare for potential disease risks, 

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,040
reducing the many costs of future disease outbreaks 

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
to keep people and the planet healthy.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,960
To learn more about the connections

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,720
