1
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:09,535
幾個世紀以來，我們研究了這個星球上許許多多變化萬千的物種…

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,840
…來幫助我們瞭解…

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,240
…生生不息的自然界如何運作

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,935
世界上數以千計的研究機構及其學者…

5
00:00:20,935 --> 00:00:24,045
投注了許多努力、生產知識，分享在…

6
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:26,925
…數百萬的論文發表和研究著作中

7
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:30,940
便能輕易的找到這些資訊。

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,840
在這些資訊背後，大部分的數據…

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,840
…四處分散、不易取得…

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,955
這些原始數據若能進一步分析、利用且再重覆利用，

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,160
…也不易用來分析及重覆使用

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,360
而資料分析及重覆使用正是創造及增進知識必要的基礎。

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,900
您能夠想像：如果有更多人能夠找到…

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,160
…並能輕易地利用經過組織的資料…

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,500
…我們將能發掘出多少關於自然界的知識嗎？

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,540
全球生物多樣性資訊機構（GBIF）

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,340
是一個由各國政府及相關機構形成的網絡

18
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,660
它推動了資料的發表

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,280
並且讓全世界共享

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,680
讓生物多樣性的資訊

21
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,740
能夠無時無刻地在線上、從任何地點

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,740
提供給研究人員及公民大眾使用

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,100
In response to recommendations

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,320
from international agreements and conventions,

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,720
GBIF includes dozens of participating countries

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,760
and nearly 2,000 publishers,

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,720
bringing together a global scale data infrastructure for the natural world

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,520
that informs the sustainable use of biodiversity

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,680
and contributes to improving people’s quality of life.

30
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,800
GBIF allows you to share the data that you capture,

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,600
organize, standardize and publish,

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,600
contributing to research, education and decision-making

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,060
and expanding the knowledge we have about our environment.

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,635
Data publishers can choose the type of use and attribution

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,340
that they want for their data

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,680
and receive public recognition for their contributions.

37
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,840
GBIF also makes it possible

38
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,740
for any citizen of the world, including you,

39
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,000
to access all the free and open data

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,760
published through the network’s data portals.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,200
The nodes from each one of the participating countries

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,480
advise and work with organizations

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,200
through all phases of the data publishing process

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,900
to guarantee high-quality data, that are open and accessible.

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,300
We want you to be part of GBIF,

46
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,080
so that together we can build a sustainable future

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,080
in which biodiversity information is free and universally available

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,240
to science and society.

49
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,200
